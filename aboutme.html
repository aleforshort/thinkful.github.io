		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p><em>Hi everyone!</em> I am Alejandra but you can call me Ale. I am an accountant who is working hard to become a Front End Web Developer. I am a creative person by nature, which is why I questioned myself "why am I in accounting?" Coding for me is a way to express my creativity by solving real life business problems, in addition to creating beautiful websites to show all my friends what I have been up to in NYC!</p>
		<br />
		<p>Growing up there wasn't much talk about computers, in fact I did not have one until I started working in NYC! But this explosion of social media caught my attention big time. Now I enjoy sharing my experiences through Facebook and Instagram hoping to engage my audience (a few for now...) and getting inspired by women who are pros in the Tech world.</p> 
		<br />
		<p>Now that I have embarked in this new adventure that is learning to code, what I value the most is people who are inspiring and resourceful. Time well spent with a group of individuals that contribute to my development.</p>
